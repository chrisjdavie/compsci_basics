# Compsci Basics

I'm from a Physics background, so computer science fundamentals are still a weak point. And therefore I learn.

## Subject 1 - Dynamic Programming

I'm not too bad at this, but my formal understanding is pretty limited. So, start from here

| Problem   | Link  | Solutions  |
| --------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Fibonacci  | https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/?p=12635  | Recursive, memoization, tabulation, sensible  |
| Longest Common Subsequence  | https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-common-subsequence/0  | Recursive, memoization, tabulation  |
| Longest Increasing Subsequence  | https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/0  | Tabulation, recursive, memoization  |
| Edit Distance  | https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-5-edit-distance/  | Recursive, memoization, tabulation  |
| Partition problem  | https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-18-partition-problem/  |  |

### Redo

Wasn't happy with how I performed on these

| Problem  | Solution  | Notes  |
| -------- | --------- | ------ |
| Longest Increasing Subsequence  | Recursive  | I couldn't figure out the recursive solution without a hint  |
