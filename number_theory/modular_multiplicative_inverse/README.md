This one is a pain - I assumed there was a clever general case. There isn't, it's just check each one. I really should get into the habit of implementing the simple case and then seeing if it's good enough...

There is a clever case for coprimes and primes, but that's... well, more niche than I'm interested in perhaps. Reading up on it (the wiki), it says that the relationship I'm looking for exists if the two variables are coprime (and says there's a proof, didn't follow it), but looking at the code, it doesn't have a path to show what would happen if there's an invalid solution.
