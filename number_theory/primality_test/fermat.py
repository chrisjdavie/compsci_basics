"""
This is a probabilistic method, and isn't used alone in pratical applications
(is sometimes used as a pre-filter in cryptography).

Using random numbers, check that:

Fermat's Little Theorem:
If n is a prime number, then for every a, 1 <= a < n,

a^(n-1) â‰¡ 1 (mod n)
 OR 
a^(n-1) % n = 1 

This doesn't always hold. There are False Fermats, which hold for the above 
but it's not a prime (hence k tries). There are also Carmichael numbers which
always hold for the above but aren't primes.

(Infinitely many. A smaller infinite that the infinite of primes, but still
enough that this method isn't used alone)
